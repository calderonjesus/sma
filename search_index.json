Rey, a central figure in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, was missing from merchandise 1.2 People Noticed… She’s the main character! How could you leave her out? 1.3 … and a Tweetstorm followed Ten Weeks of #WhereIsRey on Twitter (Miranda, 2019) 1.4 Some fans were more influential than others The Most Prominent Fans in the #WhereIsRey Conversation (Miranda, 2019) 1.5 Why Do We About Care Social Media Analytics? Social Media can be a “listening post” Disney defines it as “customer-centric tools companies use to assess the customer experience and identify areas where customer needs are not being met.” Social data is big, changes fast, and may be multi-dimensional or unstructured, therefore we need data tools. Social Media Analysis can also identify influential nodes: Nodes that are highly related and/or highly interactive. Lower cost of engaging with a single / a few social actors. We can learn techniques that are useful in domains outside Social Media: Social Network Analysis: used in fraud analytics, Anti-Money Laundering, Network Analysis, Entity Relationship Analysis, etc. Text Analysis: automated extraction and summarization of information 1.6 A (Partial) Map of the Internet A Network Map: partial map of the Internet based on the January 15, 2005 data found on opte.org. (Wikipedia) 1.7 Defining “Social” “Social” as defined by Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary Three key elements: Profiles Interaction Relationships 1.8 Profiles Describe people, organizations, and other social entities. Contain structured and unstructured data: Structured data: It is of a predictable type (number, character, date, etc) and structure. Can be easily organized in tables or groups of tables. Examples: name, location, gender, date of birth, etc. Unstructured data: Variable form. Cannot be easily organized. Example: an opinion about an event or object written in English, a picture of a puppy, an audio recording of an interview, etc. 1.9 Sample Profiles: Journalists covering Social Media Taylor Lorenz on Twitter Casey Newton on Facebook 1.10 Interactions The nature and content of people’s communications or actions. Interactions can be: Transactions: buy/sell, agree through a contract Communications: press releases from a company, articles about a company, social media posts by an individual Behaviours caught on film 1.11 An Interaction “An interaction” 1.12 Relationships Two types of relationships: Standing or long-term relationships: Exist by virtue of membership in a family or other social group. They can be manifested by connections on LinkedIn, followers on Twitter, or friends on Facebook. Ad hoc relationships: Exist around interactions. Replying, reposting or linking to a post. Relationships give rise to social orderings such as groups, status, and hierarchy. 1.13 Relationships (cont.) The analysis of relationships can provide actionable insights. Who is the most connected node in the network that can retransmit a message more easily? How much is an influencer’s message worth? Who is disseminating fake news items? Relationships may also exist between people and other social artifacts: Location Events Technologies 1.14 A Network Map Network Maps (Miranda, 2019) 1.15 Social Data The five Vs of Big Data Volume: huge amounts of data Velocity: the speed of accumulation of data is high or, equivalently, data is produced very fast Variety: the nature of data can be structured or unstructured, it can involve different types of data (numbers, text, dates, pictures, links, etc.) Veracity: inconsistencies and uncertainty in data, as data can be messy and quality/accuracy are difficult to control Value can be obtained from Big Data, but value has to be extracted and is not readily available Social Data will generally be Big Data 1.16 Analytics Analytics may refer to a process and a product: A process that is the systematic computational analysis of data The resulting product of such analysis, which is informative and insightful 1.17 A Systematic Process 1.17.1 Data analysis generally includes the following iterative steps: Gathering data: Manually Harvested from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or through scraping Cleaning and preparing data: Data validation Data structures Analysis: An iterative process May result in more questions 1.18 An Informative and Insightful Product Provides value to the users: a person, an organization, or society Tell a coherent story or make a solid argument Use visual representations of complex relationships It should add value: Support and legitimize a strategic direction or maneuver Help craft new tactics 1.19 Skills of a Social Media Data Analyst (team) Domain knowledge and problem identification: helps determine what is meaningful from what is not. One needs to understand the problem, business, audience, etc. Pattern recognition: we need to identify patterns that generalize well to data we have not yet seen Quantitative skills: statistics, time-series analysis, graph theory, etc. Technical skills: manipulation and preparation of structured and unstructured data, Big Data, etc. Visualization: not trivial and requires good design skills Curiosity and problem solving 1.20 Listening to Key Stakeholders Detect problems Identify problems as they emerge and take corrective action at early stage Understand sentiment Understand stakeholders’ messages as they convey emotions Identify emotional hotspots Combination of strong sentiment and centrality (influence) within a social network Help determine where to listen Optimize the use of organization’s resources 1.21 SMA for Understanding Social Groups Visualize configurations of social ties Identify influential actors Ascertain group fault lines 1.22 SMA for Benchmarking Organizational Strategies User make critical decisions on Friending: who becomes your friend Exposure to information shared by their friends within their own news feeds Inferences made from whom you friend with (symbolic consequences) Reciprocate friending What to post 1.23 SMA for Managing Conflicts Determine whether a social group is polarized Represent competing parties’ semantic networks "],["social-network-analysis.html", "2 Social Network Analysis 2.1 The Origins of SNA 2.2 Surveillance in GDR 2.3 The Small World Experiments and Kevin Bacon 2.4 High-Impact Applications 2.5 SNA Terminology: Nodes 2.6 Networks 2.7 Ties 2.8 Components 2.9 Weak Ties in a Network 2.10 Why Do Networks Form? 2.11 Types of Social Networks 2.12 Types of Networks 2.13 Visualizing Social Networks: Network Data 2.14 Visualizing Social Networks 2.15 Visualization tools 2.16 Visualization in Gephi 2.17 Layout Algorithms 2.18 Social Network Metrics 2.19 Paths and Components 2.20 Geodesic Distance 2.21 Density and Modularity 2.22 Network Centralization 2.23 Clustering coefficient 2.24 Ego Metrics: Centrality Metrics and Degree Centrality 2.25 Other Centrality Metrics", " 2 Social Network Analysis 2.1 The Origins of SNA Methods for studying social networks were first developed by Georg Simmel, a sociologist Sociometry: Developed in the 1930s by Jacob Moreno and Helen Jennings Study of social network phenomena Preference-based social structures Structures can be shown in sociograms or social network diagrams Founded journal Sociometry in 1937 Graph in Moreno’s Who Shall Survive 2.2 Surveillance in GDR Bernd Jentzsch’s social network (Miranda, 2019) Social network diagram believed to be produced based on Stasi surveillence. Julia Argwin: modern-day surveillance (by governments, corporations, and individuals) is a high/tech version of Stasi surveillance and SNA. 2.3 The Small World Experiments and Kevin Bacon Small World Experiments Conducted by Stanley Milgram in 1960s Select two random individuals and send an object (a folder) from one to the other Object to be passed from acquaintance to acquaintance Track people involved Number of intermediaries used to connect source to target ranged from two to ten, and averaged six Six Degrees to Kevin Bacon (Hansen, 2019) 2.4 High-Impact Applications AIDS patient contact tracing During late 1970s and early 1980s used by CDC Used to identify patient zero in North America, an Air Canada flight attendant Limits of SNA: further analysis indicated that other patients contracted AIDS virus earlier. Sociometry borrowed tools from graph theory and matrix algebra During the 1990s, software tools for SNA appear 2.5 SNA Terminology: Nodes Node A discrete actor (e.g., person, organization, group, etc.) or entity (e.g., place, object, event, or concept). Also called vertex Ego A focal node A node of particular interest Alter Nodes surrounding the ego A sample network 2.6 Networks Complete network Entire network of a particular social space Ego network Nodes surrounding the focal ego Ego network is highlighted 2.7 Ties Tie A link between nodes Also called Edge Reciprocity Reciprocated: mutual Unreciprocated: not returned Strength Strong tie: positive affect, repetitive engagements, multiplexity Weak tie: among acquaintances, has informational advantages Cardinality of nodes Dyad: relationship between two nodes Triad: relationship among three nodes Position Central: pass-through node for most ties Peripheral: outlying nodes in a network 2.8 Components Component A node or collection of nodes Separated from rest of a network Can be a node, dyad, triad, or more complex network Information brokers An individual that connects otherwise disconnected components All otherwise disconnected components are internal to the organization Boundary spanner Connects otherwise disconnected components, but some of the components are external to the organization 2.9 Weak Ties in a Network Information brokers and boundary spanners Tend to be weak ties They are useful for disseminating information across components 2.10 Why Do Networks Form? Propinquity Physical proximity Homophily Demographic or other forms of similarity Transitivity Tendency for ties to achieve balance and avoid dissonance Gives rise to network closure (fully connected network) 2.11 Types of Social Networks Directed network Can have, both, reciprocated and unreciprocated ties Examples: Twitter, favs, payments, email Reciprocated ties are shown as ties with bi-directional arrows Unreciprocated ties are shown with single direction arrows Undirected network All ties are reciprocated Examples: LinkedIn, Facebook, co-authors, members of board of directors A directed network showing a data model (Neo4j) 2.12 Types of Networks One-Mode Network All nodes are entities of same type Two-Mode Network Nodes are entities of different types A two-mode network from the ICIJ’s Panama Papers Investigation 2.13 Visualizing Social Networks: Network Data Network data needs to be setup in the form that the software package requires it There are two main forms to setup network data: Adjacency matrix Edge list Adjacency matrix n x n matrix, where n is the number of nodes Symmetric matrix if undirected network Generally (but not necessarily), we will see an asymmetric matrix if we have a directed network Edge list Lists of connected pairs, i.e., between every pair of nodes there is a tie Order is not important in undirected network Order is fundamental in directed network 2.14 Visualizing Social Networks Bavelas and Leavitt’s networks (Miranda, 2019) 2.15 Visualization tools NodeXL: an Excel template. Simple, but limited by spreadsheet’s limitations UCINet: range of metrics and stats Pajek: analysis and visualization of very large networks Gephi: powerful visualization tool R: multiple packages for SNA 2.16 Visualization in Gephi A network graph produced in Gephi 2.17 Layout Algorithms Random algorithm Assigns each node to a random position Tries to avoid collisions / overlapping nodes Force-directed layout algorithms Iteratively bring together connected nodes and push apart unconnected nodes Examples: Fruchterman-Reingold and Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale Tree layout algorithms Ideal for depicting hierarchical social structures 2.18 Social Network Metrics Subgraph A subset of a graph that we want to analyze Metrics provide information about the properties of an entire network beyond what we can visualize 2.19 Paths and Components If a path between two nodes exists, we say that one node is reachable from the other Connected component A single node that is disconnected from the rest of the network, i.e., an isolate Multiple nodes that are connected among themselves, but unreachable from the rest of the network 2.20 Geodesic Distance Geodesic Distance (GeoDist) GeoDist between two nodes: shortest path between two nodes GeoDist distance of a graph: the maximum geodesic distance in the graph GeoDist measures communication efficiency Fewer hops, imply faster and better communication GeoDist also indicates cohesion A larger max or average GeoDist, indicates that the network can be easily fragmented 2.21 Density and Modularity Density Proportion of all possible ties that exist or are realized Modularity Measures the extent to which the network contains densely connected modules to the inside, but sparsely connected modules among themselves Modularity depends on the algorithm applied 2.22 Network Centralization Measures the extent to which information or other resource flows through one node Can be calculated from any of the ego centrality measures Measures centralization as the sum of differences between the maximum centrality value and each individual one scaled by the maximum potential centrality 2.23 Clustering coefficient For a graph, it is calculated as the average of clustering coefficient of each node It measures the proportion of cluster members who are tied to each other It captures the cliquishness of a graph 2.24 Ego Metrics: Centrality Metrics and Degree Centrality Centrality Measures the prominence of a node A node is prominent because of degree centrality, betweenness centrality or closeness centrality Degree centrality The count of an ego’s direct connections For directed networks, we can calculate the in-degree centrality and the out-degree centrality Many times, degree centrality is normalized by the total tie count in the network Eigenvector centrality A relative measure of degree centrality Adjusts a node’s prominence based on the relative prominence of odes to which it is tied Eigenvector centrality attaches prominence to nodes that are undertaking strategic or efficient activity 2.25 Other Centrality Metrics Betweenness centrality Measures the number of indirect ties a node mediates Equivalently, measures the number of geodesic paths in which the node acts as a bridge Closeness centrality Measures closeness by considering the inverse of the number of hops to each other node More hops mean that the other nodes are farther apart Clustering coefficient Proportion of one’s ties that are also tied to each other Speaks to the extent to which social structures around the ego are structurally equivalent A clique is a fully connected subgroup within a network "],["visualizing-social-networks-1.html", "3 Visualizing Social Networks", " 3 Visualizing Social Networks Social Network Visualization "],["subgroup-analysis.html", "4 Subgroup Analysis", " 4 Subgroup Analysis Subgroup analysis "],["clustering.html", "5 Clustering", " 5 Clustering Clustering in social networks.
